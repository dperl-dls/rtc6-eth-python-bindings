# rtc6py

RTC6 ethernet laser controller python bindings

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

:---:           | :---:
Releases        | <https://github.com/dperl-dls/rtc6-eth-python-bindings/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from rtc6py import __version__

print(f"Hello rtc6py {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m rtc6py --version
```
